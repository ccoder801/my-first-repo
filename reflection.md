Gaining knowledge of GitHub has improved my comprehension of cooperation and version control.
Git commands like commit, push, and merge were initially unclear, but they became clearer with practice. 
Working with branches and pull requests has enhanced teamwork, and managing repositories has allowed me to track changes effectively.
I have also learned structured problem-solving techniques via the issue tracking system. 
I've learned about industry best practices from investigating open-source applications.
Merge disputes were difficult to resolve, but getting beyond them gave me more confidence.
All things considered, GitHub has helped me get ready for real-world software development by streamlining and organizing project management and collaboration.
